# The curious case of github urls
While trying to sync my local copy with the github copy of a work, I was greeted with this
error message: 
```
remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
remote: Please see https://docs.github.com/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls for information on currently recommended modes of authentication.
```
When looking at he error message, it tells why it is not working and what I can do to accomplish my end goal.
* password authentication is removed.
* read and pick an alternative authentication method from the help page.

The solution I choose is to go with
Personal access token are passwords *generated by github* and given to us, to use just like password, so much so that it has
all the security weakness of a password too. :)

Personal access token needs to be assigned with permissions explicitly. In the case of ``pull``, grant read access to contents of the repo.
